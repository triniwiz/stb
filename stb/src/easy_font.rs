//! Intended for when you just want to get some text displaying in a 3D app as quickly as possible.
//!
//! Rust implementation notes:
//!
//! `stb_easy_font_print` accepts a buffer for quads with the size of your choice.
//! Currently `stb` C API offers no way to predict buffer's size depending on text string.
//! If the buffer is not large enought, quads will be truncated.
